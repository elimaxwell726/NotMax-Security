# Network Traffic Analysis (NTA)



* Network Traffic analysis lets you inspect and find threats in every byte and every layer of the TCP/IP model.
* Headers provide valuable info as to what is going on and we can use these headers to notice suspicious activity.
* Session hijacking can be detected by analyzing the sequence numbers included in the header. 
* To evade an IDS, attackers may use a fragmentation attack.
* Ingress = Inbound traffic
* Egress = Outbound traffic
* HTTPS is a good example of North-South (NS) traffic.
* Endpoint connections generate the most traffic in a network
* Network traffic analysis focuses on combining multiple sources of information, analyzing them, finding patterns, and using the results to inform actions.
